Data Product Prototype: Anti-vice Savings Calculator
========================================================

The purpose of this "experiment" is to highlight how much money we can spend (or save) because of our vices.
In this case I have made more emphasis on tobacco, although this can be used with other things (beers, partying, unnecesary expenses...).

Bear in mind that sometimes vices not only take away our money... but also our health. According to a paper from the Univerity of California, Berkeley (April 2000) each cigarette decrease our life expectancy 11 minutes. It is up to you.


How to use this calculator
========================================================
The calculator has 4 boxes to fill:

- How many cigarettes do you smoke daily?
- How many cigarettes have the packets you buy?
- How much is each packet?
- Chose a period to find out how much you will save during it.



How to use this calculator (2)
========================================================

After pressing "Submit", the output will return 5 figures:

- Savings per day.
- Chosen period in days.
- Total savings.
- All the cigarettes not smoked during this period.
- The potential improvement of your life expectancy, in years.


Hope you like it!
